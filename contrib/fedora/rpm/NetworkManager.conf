# Configuration file for NetworkManager.
#
# See "man 5 NetworkManager.conf" for details.
#
# The directory /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/ can contain additional configuration
# snippets installed by packages. These files are read before NetworkManager.conf
# and have thus lowest priority.
# The directory /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/ can contain additional configuration
# snippets. Those snippets override the settings from this main file.
#
# The files within one conf.d/ directory are read in asciibetical order.
#
# If /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/ contains a file with the same name as
# /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/, the latter file is shadowed and thus ignored.
# Hence, to disable loading a file from /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/ you can
# put an empty file with the same name.
#
# If two files define the same key, the one that is read afterwards will overwrite
# the previous one.
